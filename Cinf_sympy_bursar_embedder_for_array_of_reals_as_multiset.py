# Embed list of real numbers treated as multiset.
# E.g. this method can embed things like:
#
#        [[3,2],[4,1],[-2,1]]
#
# when the above represents the size n=3 multiset of m=2-vectors:
#
#        {{ [3,2],[4,1],[-2,1] }}
#
# Although this implementation claims to only operate on arrays of reals, 
# it might be able to embed complex arrays, albeit to complex outputs.
# This could be used by a complexly compressed method (see below).
# 
# If k==0 the number of outputs is also zero. If k>=1 then the number of outputs should be 
#
#          ORDER(n, k) == n + (k-1)*n*(n+1)/2  
#
# where n is the number of vectors in the set, and m is the dimension of each of those vectors. 
# This order has leading term 
#
#                k*n*n/2.
#
# Here is an $(n,k)=(2,3)$ example:
# Embedding  $\{(3,1,4),(2,2,5)\}$ should generate
# 
#       [9, 3, 5,     20, 13, 25, 8, 6]
#
# since the polynomial
#
#       $(y + (3+1x+4x^2))(y+(2+2x+5x^2))$
#
# is equal to 
#
#       $y^2 + y^1 (9 x^2 + 3 x + 5) + y^0 (20 x^4 + 13 x^3 + 25 x^2 + 8 x + 6)$
#
# .
# Note that if $k$ were even we could set up the vectors as being complex but of 
# dimension $k/2$.  This would lead to the COMPRESSED_ORDER being 
#
#       COMPRESSED_ORDER = 2*ORDER(n,k/2)
#                        = 2*( n + (k/2-1)*n*(n+1)/2 )
#                        = 2*n + (k-2)*n*(n+1)/2
#                        = 2*n + (k-1)*n*(n+1)/2 - n*(n+1)/2
#                        = ORDER(n,k) + n - n*(n+1)/2
#                        = ORDER(n,k) - ( n*(n+1)/2 - n )
#                        = ORDER(n,k) - n*( (n+1)/2 - 1 )
#                        = ORDER(n,k) - n*(n-1)/2
#
# which is less than ORDER(n,k) by n*(n-1)/2 ... but still has leading term k*n*n/2.
