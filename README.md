This is a library for continuous encodings of multisets of vectors in R^m.


In principle, all encoders expect only reals or real vectors and generate only reals.

Internally, some may use complex representations, however such routines should be considered private (unexposed) even if technically visible. This is to allow interface standardisation.


./test.py is the example/test script.

Note to self: one could complexify the Bursar's idea.
