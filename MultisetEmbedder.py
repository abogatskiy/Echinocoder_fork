class MultisetEmbedder:
    """
    This is a base class for objects which embed length-n sets of k-vectors.

    Encoders are not necessarily embedders since encoders do not need to be injective. 
    All embedders are encoders, however.

    Strictly speaking these are "multisets" not "sets" since the sets can hold repeated objects
    and retain knowledge of the number of repeats.  However, we are sometimes guity of 
    abbreviating "multiset" to just "set".

    The set to be embed should be inputs as a 2D numpy array with shape (n,k).
    The order of the vectors within the numpy array can be arbitrary
    E.g. to embed a multiset containing the 2-vectors (2,2), (4,5) and (1,2) one could call
    
        embed(np.asarray([[2,2], [4,5], [1,2]]))

    or

        embed(np.asarray([[4,5], [2,2], [1,2]]))

    and both should have the same output -- at least up to numerical precision. This leeway (permission to 
    have small deviations on account of floating point precision, rather than demanding bit-for-bit identical embeddings) is granted to implementations in order to allow them to be faster (sometimes) than would be the case if they were all required to canonicalise their input sets.  Someone wanting bit-for-bit identical output under permutations of input vectors could easily sort their vectors (in any way) prior to using any embedder.

    All embedders return one dimensional arrays of real floats.

    In principle, a given embedder "Alice" can embed sets of different sizes n and or k.  However, 
    some embedders might wish to restrict themselves to certain fixed n or k at initialisation (e.g. if 
    an embedder were to need a significant amount of n and k dependent set-up cost that it wished to do
    once only).  Thus all embedders are expected to be able to tell callers what sizes of input they can and cannot embed, and how long the possible embeddings will be.  Derived classes do this by implementing the method

        size_from_n_k(n: int, k, int) -> int:

    for which:
        * a return value of >=0 is the number of reals in an embedding if sets of size (n,k) are encodable, and
        * a return value of -1 indicates that embedding for that n and k is impossible.

    No embedder should have to deal with $k<0$ or $n<0$ as these are crazy nonsense.
